# Introduction
Merging two different data sets requires a unique key. There is a long standing problem in educational policy where different organizations with similar data
either can not, or will not utilize the same key. This puts educational and institutional researchers in a position to manufacture crosswalk tables in order to expand their understanding about students and institutions. 

This project attempts to create a crosswalk between the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) data and the CEEB codes utilized by testing agencies including SAT and ACT. 

Many institutional researchers and scholars (a few examples here) have taclked this problem before, often using fuzzy matching methods which are helpful, but imprecise.  This project attempts to provide a reproducible, open-source framework to solve this problem along with a freely-available data set available to anyone.
